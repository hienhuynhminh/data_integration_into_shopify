# Web Scrapping and Image Analysis

## Project Description
* For my graduation thesis, I was interested in user-generated content, specifically review photographs on TripAdvisor.
* Here, I demonstrate how I gathered data, namely review texts and review photos, from TripAdvisor. Then, using the review photos that I have collected, I demonstrate how I extract photographic attributes (e.g. brightness, colorfulness etc.) to gain insights from user-generated photos on a review platform like TripAdvisor.
