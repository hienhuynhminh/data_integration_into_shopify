# Image Classification (with Images in AWS S3)

## Project Description
* An e-commerce business runs a webshop to advertise their furniture products. Hence, each product is displayed with several images. The images can be categorised into different classes, for example, product images (e.g. a wooden chair with a white background) or ambient images (e.g. a couch being placed in a living room with other items like a coffee table or a lamp).
* A machine learning model (a convolutional neural network) was trained to classify these types of images. Performance was fairly good (the accuracy rate was high), therefore, we decided to deploy the model on our production data.
